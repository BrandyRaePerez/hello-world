Hello there!

The fingers on the keyboard belong to a young adult by the name of Brandy. The fingers on the keyboard often become fingers on a screen, managing social media channels in exchange for currency and sustinance. The fingers on the keyboard also become fingers on the coffee cup, the shutter release, the paint brush, the two kitty cats who nibble on said fingers. Brandy enjoys it all.
